# iFoodie

### About
iFoodie is a React Native iOS app where users can rate and save their favorite restaurants and dishes.

Users can create a restaurant entry and add multiple dishes which include the option to add a photo, select dish type (appetizer, main course, desert, etc) and log their experiences.
Users can also view past restaurants they've been to in the past and edit their entries accordingly.

### The Team
iFoodie was built with love at the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. 
The team consists of [Laura Jeong](https://github.com/ellejeong) and [Meredith Kiung](https://github.com/mlkiung).
